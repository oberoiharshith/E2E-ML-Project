Student Performance Indicator

Project Overview
This project aims to accurately predict student performance through an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. By leveraging various regression techniques, we have developed a model that achieves an R^2 score of 88.57%, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting student outcomes. This predictive model can serve as a vital tool for educational institutions seeking to identify and support students at risk of underperforming.

Features
Comprehensive Data Analysis: Utilization of advanced data preprocessing and analysis techniques to understand key factors influencing student performance.
Multiple Regression Models: Exploration of various regression models, including CatBoost, AdaBoost, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Lasso, Ridge, RandomForest, K-Nearest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, to identify the most effective predictor.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Application of systematic hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Model Deployment: Deployment of the final model on AWS Beanstalk for easy access and scalability.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implementation of AWS CodePipeline for streamlined updates and deployment processes.
